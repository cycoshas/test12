It is common for women to get worried or even suffer a mild form of depression when they notice their hair is going off by the handful. Hair loss in any way is an unpleasant experience for every self-aware woman, which is not helped by a lingering feeling of helplessness and hopelessness that often accompany such conditions. This article examines in details whether such fears are justifiable or unfounded, for them to worry over, and addresses several other things they do not know about hair loss and [how much hair loss is normal for a woman](11hairstyles.com/much-hair-loss-normal-woman/).

 WHEN IS HAIR LOSS NORMAL FOR A WOMAN?

The American Hair Loss Council states that the normal hair fall in a woman is about 100-125 hairs per day, while figures from other experts may vary in this regard. Some studies have it that about 90 percent of hair loss in women is temporary. While the earlier stated facts may sound the alarm bell to a lot of women, it is pertinent for them to know that they have a total number of hairs ranging between 90,000-150,000. Therefore, losing about 100 hairs may not be an unusual occurrence if they shampoo and brush them every day, ironically, such mild hair loss in women often goes unnoticed.

Even though this condition may start at puberty, it becomes apparent after menopause, and in most cases is replaced. Another plausible explanation for such hair loss might be that you have long hairs which get caught in the brush or fall on the floor, while on the other hand having shorter hair locks means you are likely to shed less. Based on the above explanation, if you find yourself in this awkward situation, you need not panic, because you might not be the only woman out there going through such things. Another important factor to consider is the fact that about 90 percent of hair is in a growing phase, while the remaining 10 percent is in the ‘resting’ phase. Hairs in the resting phase mean that they will fall out and make allowance for new growth of hair over a period.


The most common form of hair loss in women is known as androgenetic alopecia and is often known as baldness or female pattern alopecia. It is usually characterized by the thinning of hair mainly over the sides and top of the head and has been found to affect one out of every three women. You may be experiencing actual hair loss when the lost hair does not re-grow, and the hair shed goes past 125 per day. Also, severe hair loss problem becomes noticeable with a loss of about 10-50 percent of hairs on any part of the head. However, certain factors are responsible for hair loss, and noticeable signs that characterize it, which you need to, familiarize yourself with.
